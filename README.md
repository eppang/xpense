## Overview
### Week 1
So far, we have created quick and simple mockups of our app pages.
### Week 2
We have created the HTML mockups of our app based on our original mockups.
### Week 3
We have created a basic backend with a working login authentication system to work with our HTML pages.
### Week 4
We have wrapped up deveopment for our app, and have impelemented a basic working database using MongoDB with our app. In addition to this, we have made small improvements on the functionability of some of the apps features, most notably the increased security requirements for user authentication and additional functionality of the account overview page. We have released our app and created a wiki page for it which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/eppang/xpense/wiki).
